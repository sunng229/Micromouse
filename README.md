## Micromouse

An autonomous maze solving robot for the IEEE club at UCLA. The goal is to build and design a robot that autonomously naviagtes through a 16x16 maze to reach the center and back as fast as possible.

It accomplishes this using IR sensors to detect any walls, continously storing that data as it continues its path primarily using an algorithm called Floodfill, which is implemented in solver.c inside the Src folder.
